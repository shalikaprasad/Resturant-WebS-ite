                    Ayubowan! (May you live long) <br> Nearly half a century ago, our legendary brand of hospitality was born on this very coastline. From the warm hearts of a Sri Lankan family, the values of passion, humility, integrity, and tenacity
                    were brought to life in a charming beachside villa that has since inspired a world of luxury spread across our tropical isle. It all began here â€“ at our original home of Sri Lankan hospitality. The home in which we welcomed the world
                    as part of our family, and treated the world as one of our own. From mouth-watering meals to unique experiences, we have always been delighted to share the magic of our land with you. And today, as our timeless seas hold a wealth of
                    stories past, we invite you to our nostalgic shores to begin one of your own.
